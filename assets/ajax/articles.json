        "articleParagraph": "The Blue Lagoon, a geothermal spa, is located on a lava field near Grindavik. It was first discovered in the early 1980s by local residents as they were the first ones to use these water reservoirs to bathe. The bioactive properties of Blue Lagoon’s geothermal water, give the water its healing properties making it not only a good place for relaxation and pleasure but also a place of health and wellbeing.",
        "articleHiddenParagraph": "The water has a milky blue shade due to high concentration of silica. Silica forms soft white mud on the bottom of the lake which visitors use to rub on themselves. Because Blue Lagoon is man-made, water that formed reservoirs is a byproduct of nearby geothermal power plant, “Svartsengi”. In 2018, “Retreat at Blue Lagoon Iceland” was built, it is a luxurious geothermal resort containing luxy hotel, subterranean spa, terraced lagoon, and a restaurant. This is a place where visitors can stay and enjoy in harmonic convergence of nature, design, and science."
